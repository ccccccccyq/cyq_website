## **Places to go:**

**The Bund** (must visit it at night!! although lots of people, still a must place to visit)  
Zhongshan Rd (E-1), Waitan, Huangpu, Shanghai, China, 200002

**Tian Zi Fang** (must visit!!! the place where traditional Shanghainese go; many cafes and lots of low-price Shanghai gadgets)  
210 Taikang Rd, Huangpu, China, 200023

**Oriental Pearl TV Tower**  
1 Shiji Blvd, Lujiazui, Pudong, Shanghai, China, 200120

**Shanghai Tower** (the 2nd tallest tower in the world maybe)  
501 Yincheng Rd (M), Lujiazui, Pudong, Shanghai, China, 200120

If there isn't enough time, u guys may choose one from the above tower to visit and that's enough.  
But plz choose a sunny day to visit cuz u can't see any view on the tower if the weather is bad!!!
Also u can take a stroll around **Lujiazui** while you're at these two towers. Like **Shanghai History Museum** and 
**Super Brand Mall** are all good place to visit.

**Wu Kang Lu**  
Xuhui District, Shanghai, China, 200031

**Tian Ai Lu**  
Luxun Park, Hongkou District, Shanghai, China

**Nanjing Rd Pedestrian Street**  
China, Shanghai, Huangpu, China, 200001

Lu means road in Chinese. If u want to have a citywalk in Shanghai, I recommend the above three. **Wu Kang Lu** has more romantic aroma and except for **Wu Kang Mansion** (a famous building), there're lots of coffee shops, flower shops, restaurants and some hidden gems on that rd. **Tian Ai Lu** is similar to Wu Kang Lu. It's not very famous but little-known. **Nanjing Rd Pedestrian Street** is the most famous street in China. If u want to go shopping and by some shanghai products, u can go to this street. It's too commercial now, but still a good choice to buy some authentic shanghai specialties.

**Yu Garden**  


**Cheng Huang Temple**
6FC5+V6C, Xiaochanglu, yuyuan laojie, Shanghai, China, 200010

**Shanghai Disneyland Park** (may take a whole day to visit, I'm not very interested in that, but u guys may like it!!)  
4MV5+945, Pudong, Shanghai, China, 201205

## **Places to eat:**

Crab Roe Noodles
West Nanjing Rd

Shanghainese Cuisine

DONG TAI XIANG SHANGHAI DIM SUM   
東泰祥生煎馆  
It's a chain store, so u guys can find the nearest branch.  

裕兴记·蟹黄面馆

## **Other things recommend:**

Several public transportation in Shanghai: on foot, by shared-bikes, by metro or **by ferry** (no need for the sightseeing ferry on Huangpu River!! So expensive, just take the shuttle ferry is high cost performance.)
